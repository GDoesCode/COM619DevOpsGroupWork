### [Click Here to to view our Mapping Application](https://opennms1uksouthcloudazureapp.brazilsouth.cloudapp.azure.com:8080)

Our Project Application Mapping Application which allows users to view Points Of Interest that have been added by our users. The application allows you to search for Points Of Interest by a specific region that is stored on the Mapping Application's MySQL Database, allows a standard user to add a Point Of interest to the Mapping Application's MySQL Database that can be viewed by others and finally admins have the ability to edit and delete any Points Of Interests that are stored on the Mapping Application. 

That is the basics of the features and functionality of the NodeNinja's Open Source Mapping Applciation, there are more features and functionality that we have documented and explained within our wiki page. Also with our GitHub wiki page we have documentated and explained the use of our development technologies for our Mapping Application, how to run the application locally and on azure, how to contribute to our Open Source project and various other documentation to help you get a better understanding off our project and Mapping Application.

### Project Kanban Boards

Within our project we utilised two Kanban boards. One Kanban board which was our main primary Kanban board which included all the tasks that we were working on and we can view the status of each task within the Kanban swim lane to see the progress off the ticket.
#### [Main Kanban Project Task Board](https://github.com/users/GDoesCode/projects/1)

Alongside our Main Kanban Project Task Board, we utilised a simple Kanban board that just had 3 sections To Do, In Progress and Done, we utilised this requirements board just to keep up with the progress off each project requirement that was stated in the assessment brief in this project.
